    "# Lecture 3: Spark Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "_Spark Streaming_ is an extension of the Spark API that enables scalabe stream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The continous stream of input data can be ingested from many data sources such as **Kafka**, **Amazon s3** or **TCP sockets**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark API allows to process data via high-level functions such as *map* and *reduce*. As we are going to see, it is also possible to use dataframe operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Processed data can be exported to an external database and used to make live dashboards or offline analyses, or stored in files, or be used in a further stage of a Kafka pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark streaming works by dividing the input data into _micro-batches_ that can be treated as static datasets. In Spark this is referred to as a *discretized stream* (*DStream*). The DStream is represented using RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![DStream](imgs/lecture3/DStream.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any transformation applied on the DStream, i.e. anything like a `Dstream.map()`, will act independently on each batch. For example, in the image below, we can filter the original RDD to remove some data and produce a new stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "![DStream_filter](imgs/lecture3/Dstream_filter.png)\n",

    "In this lecture we will see how to setup a simple stream using a TCP socket as a data source."
